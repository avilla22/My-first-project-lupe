Lupe's Mole is a cooking website; it's a speculative design that takes users on an immersive journey through the origins and evolution of food recipes. More than just a collection of instructions, it's a platform that weaves storytelling, cultural exploration, and culinary creativity to redefine how we engage with food in the digital age. Additionally, looking at locally sourced and heritage foods in the context of stores and shops as pillars for the community. The idea of third space is hemorrhaging when ingredients are bought to make an experience. I would want to develop this idea, stripped away from paywalls, and approach making food as an invitation for healing in a time when we are experiencing a disconnect with where our food comes from. A falafel wrap is locally sourced from your corner bodega. Mole is locally sourced from my mom's knowledge. This is a declaration for self-preservation through the consumption of ephemeral creation.
